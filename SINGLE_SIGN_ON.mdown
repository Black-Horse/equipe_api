# Equipe Federation Single Sign On

Your users of the system needs to login to `https://app.equipe.com`, instead of another password for the user to remember, you can sign in users that you have already authenticated in your system. This also creates the organizer and user if they not already exists in Equipe and assigns them to your federation. You should only generate this login possibility to users that have the role of organizer.

```html
<form action="your-single-sign-on-url" method="post">
  <input type="hidden" name="organizer_id" value="your id of the organizer">
  <input type="hidden" name="organizer_name" value="name of the organizer">
  <input type="hidden" name="name" value="name of the user">
  <input type="hidden" name="email" value="email of the user">
  <input type="hidden" name="cell_phone" value="cell phone number of the user">
  <input type="hidden" name="auth_token" value="your generated token">
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

### Generate auth token

Concat the values of organizer_id, organizer_name, name, email, cell_phone and your api key. Make a `SHA256` hexdigest of the result. We will use this to verify that your are the sender of the information and that it's untouched. Your `api_key` servers as the shared secret.

### Example

```ruby
federation_api_key = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
organizer_id = 235
organizer_name = 'Helsingborg FRK'
name = 'Kim Fors'
email = 'kim.fors@example.com'
cell_phone = '+4670123123'
auth_token = Digest::SHA256.hexdigest([organizer_id, organizer_name, name, email, cell_phone, federation_api_key].join)
```

The auth_token is `ef9709e1128b447edf914ba97fc408589517ea2c1effec67f43098bd4349b6cc` for the given values above.
